    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 325°F (160°C).</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine graham cracker crumbs, 1/4 cup sugar, and melted butter. Press this mixture into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan to create the crust.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese, 1 1/4 cups sugar, and vanilla extract until smooth and creamy.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Mix in the sour cream and flour until the batter is well combined.</li>
        <li>Pour the cream cheese filling over the graham cracker crust in the pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes, or until the cheesecake is set and the edges are lightly golden. The center should still have a slight jiggle.</li>
        <li>Turn off the oven and let the cheesecake cool in the oven for 1 hour with the door slightly ajar.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4 hours, or overnight, before serving.</li>
        <li>Optional: Top with your favorite fruit compote, chocolate ganache, or whipped cream before serving.</li>
        <li>Slice and enjoy your delicious Cheesecake!</li>
