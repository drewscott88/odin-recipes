# Recipe Book Project

## Introduction

This project is a simple recipe book web application. The primary goal of this project is to showcase my skills in web development, including HTML and basic web structure. It serves as a starting point for organizing and presenting different recipes. 

### Skills Demonstrated

When I completed this project I demonstrated the following skills:

1. **HTML Structure:** I have created well-structured HTML files to present recipes in a clear and organized manner.

2. **Image Integration:** I have learned how to incorporate images into HTML files and ensure they are properly displayed.

3. **Linking:** I have set up links within the project to navigate between different recipe pages, enhancing the user experience.

4. **Content Organization:** I have organized the content with headings, descriptions, ingredient lists, and step-by-step instructions, making the recipe pages informative and easy to follow.

This project serves as a foundation for more advanced web development skills, and I look forward to building upon this experience in future projects.
